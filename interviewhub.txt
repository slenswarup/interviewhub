problems - 

1. on experience tab , we need all experience should be shown irrespective of any user has loggedin or not . but , if he clicks on any experience , then , if nobody has logged in , then it will navigate to login page , if logged in , then the experience will open 

2. when we click on any experience , all fields are not showing , like coding questions , difficulty all . all details should be shown clearly , if user has not shared any information during experience sharing , i mean , kept any field vacant , then also show that field but show it vacant

3. showing 'failed to create experience.' 

4. interview date cannot be in future.


5. views , comment , upvotes are not updating correctly .    the more number of times an experience will be opened , the views will increase accordingly

6. in profile page, under 'my interview experience' , clicking share your first experience is navigating to login page , but no need it , as he is seeing his profile , it means , he has already logged in .  and even after sharing experience , that is not being reflected to his profile page
